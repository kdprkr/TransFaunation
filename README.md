**Abstract ~pending:** <br/>

## Overview for items added pre-review that are organized into final format: <br/>
`dada2/` = contains outputs for dada2 feature table construction (see: `Script_01.R` section *Q - STEP 3* and *Q - STEP 4*) <br/>
`dvrs/` = contains outputs for alpha diversity analysis (see: `Script_01.R` section *Q - STEP 8*) <br/>
`reads/` = contains raw and trimmed sequence reads (see: `Script_01.R` sections *Q - STEP 1* and *Q - STEP 2*) <br/>
`taxa/` = contains Greengenes/SILVA taxonomic classifications for each FeatureID (see: `Script_01.R` section *Q - STEP 6*) <br/>
`tree/` = contains outputs for phylogenetic tree created in QIIME2 (see: `Script_01.R` section *Q - STEP 7*) <br/>
`Script_01.R` = manifest creation and QIIME 2 processing/analysis <br/>
`TransFaunation.Rproj` = base of operations for running scripts in R Studio <br/>

## Overview for items added pre-review that are not organized into final format: <br/>
`submission/` = remaining items produced for original submission to *Cancer Prevention Research* <br/>

## Each of the following will be added after article is published:
`class/` = contains reference sequences and trained taxonomy classifiers (see: `Script_01.R` section *Q - STEP 5*) <br/>
`main/` = pdfs for main text figures <br/>
`sampledata_TF.txt` = sample data file <br/>
`sra/` = items relevant for submission to the NCBI Sequence Read Archive ([BioProject Accession PRJNA630498](https://github.com/kdprkr/TransFaunation)) <br/>
`supplement/` = includes figures/tables/files for supplementary materials <br/>
`vault/` = central storage for items produced in each of the `.R` scripts <br/>

Due to file size restrictions, a few items cannot be uploaded into their respective locations above. To overcome this limitation, the master directory with complete materials will be compressed and uploaded to Google Drive. That directory will then be available for download by clicking "Download anyway" after visiting the following [link ~pending](https://github.com/kdprkr/TransFaunation). To setup proper file paths, download, uncompress, and move `TransFaunation/` onto the `Desktop/`. <br/>

If any files cannot be located or if any links are broken, **please open an issue**. <br/>
